            NASA's Spirit rover—and it's twin Opportunity—studied the history of climate and water at sites on Mars where conditions may once have been favorable to life.

            Spirit uncovered strong evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is now.
            Described as a "wonderful workhorse"—Spirit operated for 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days, more than 25 times its original intended lifetime.
            The rover traveled 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers) across the Martian plains.
            On May 25, 2011, NASA ended efforts to contact the marooned rover and declared its mission complete. The rover had been silent since March 2010.
